# Pong Game
This is a basic implementation of the classic Pong game built using the Raylib library in C++. The game was created as a learning project by following a tutorial on YouTube.

# Features
Simple paddle and ball mechanics.
Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
The first player to reach 11 points wins.
## How to Play
Use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to control your paddle.
Avoid letting the ball pass your paddle to score points.
## Installation
This project doesn't come with an installer; it runs directly as an .exe file.

## Steps:
Download the .exe file from the releases.

Run the .exe on your Windows machine.

Make sure Raylib dependencies are included, or install Raylib if necessary.

Note: If you'd like to compile from source, you'll need to have Raylib and a C++ compiler installed.
